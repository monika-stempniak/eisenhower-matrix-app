Additional questions and answers:

- How could we extend the application? What next features would be great to have?
  _I would add more statistics, hightlight deadine tasks if the date it is close to deadline, add tests, store todos in localStorage/Firebase_
- What way of dealing with delegating and scheduling tasks would you suggest? How to encourage user to
  stick to the Eisenhower Matrix ideas?
  _Just test to see how your productivity increase_
- How do you keep the priority of tasks on the list? How does the priority behave when we move the task
  from one quadrant to another?
  _The priority is updated to the one from the current tile_
- UI/UX: which libraries do you use? How do you choose the colors, fonts and other solutions?
  _To generate color palette I used `https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23D5B41B&sub=1` and chose `#D5B41B` as an entry color_
- How easy would be to reuse this matrix?
  _I would need to rebuild it a bit, but it's pretty easy to reuse_
